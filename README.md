# Kconfiglib #

A Python library for doing stuff with Kconfig-based configuration systems. Can
extract information, query and set symbol values, and read and write
<i>.config</i> files. Highly compatible with the <i>scripts/kconfig/\*conf</i>
utilities in the kernel, usually invoked via make targets such as
<i>menuconfig</i> and <i>defconfig</i>.

## Installation ##

Installation instructions for the Linux kernel (in the kernel root):

    $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git  
    $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch

<i>(Note: The directory name Kconfiglib/ is significant.)</i>

In addition to creating a handy interface, the make targets are needed to pick
up environment variables set in the kernel makefiles which are referenced in
the Kconfig files (<i>ARCH</i>, <i>SRCARCH</i>, and <i>KERNELVERSION</i> as of
Linux 3.7.0).

Please tell me if the patch does not apply. It should be trivial to apply
manually.

## Documentation ##

The (extensive) documentation is generated by running

    $ pydoc kconfiglib

in the <i>Kconfiglib/</i> directory. For HTML output,
use

    $ pydoc -w kconfiglib

## Examples ##

The <i>examples/</i> directory contains simple example programs that make use
of Kconfiglib. See the documentation for how to run them.

## Test suite ##

The test suite is run with

    $ python Kconfiglib/testsuite.py

It comprises a set of selftests and a set of compatibility tests that compare
configurations generated by Kconfiglib with configurations generated by
<i>scripts/kconfig/conf</i> for a number of cases. You might want to use the
"speedy" option; see testsuite.py.

## Misc. notes ##

Please tell me if you miss some API instead of digging into internals. The
internal data structures and APIs, and dependency stuff in particular, are
unlikely to be exactly what you want as a user (hence why they're internal :).
Patches are welcome too of course. ;)

<b>Note</b>: To make the API more consistent and intuitive, some methods have been
renamed as follows:

<table>
  <tr><th>From                            </th><th>To                        </th></tr>
  <tr><td>Symbol.calc_value()             </td><td>Symbol.get_value()        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Choice.calc_mode()              </td><td>Choice.get_mode()         </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Symbol.set_value()              </td><td>Symbol.set_user_value()   </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Choice.get_actual_items()       </td><td>Choice.get_symbols()      </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Symbol.is_choice_item()         </td><td>Symbol.is_choice_symbol() </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Symbol.reset()                  </td><td>Symbol.unset_user_value() </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Config.reset()                  </td><td>Config.unset_user_values()</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Menu.get_depends_on_visibility()</td><td>Menu.get_visibility()     </td></tr>
</table>


The test suite failures (should be the only ones) for the following Blackfin
defconfigs on e.g. Linux 3.7.0-rc8 are due to
[a bug in the C implementation](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/5/458):

 * arch/blackfin/configs/CM-BF537U\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF548-EZKIT\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT-V2\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/TCM-BF537\_defconfig
